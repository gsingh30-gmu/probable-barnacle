## About

Welcome to the **Discord Status Tracker**, the ultimate (not really) app for obsessively tracking your friends' public Discord statuses over time. Ever wondered what your buddy was up to at 2 AM last Tuesday? Now you can find out! 

Whether you're stalking your friends or just having a laugh, this app brings a whole new level of surveillance (kidding, kind of).

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking:** Keep an eye on your friends' Discord statuses as they change.
- **History Logs:** View a chronological history of status updates. Because who doesn't love digging into the past?
- **Notifications:** Get notified whenever your friends change their status. Stay updated on all their moods!
- **Privacy Settings:** Just kidding! All statuses are public. Privacy? What's that?
- **Sleek UI:** A minimalist design that's as straightforward as your stalking.
